My name is Michelle Wahng. I'm a native Californian, but have been a resident of Massachusetts since January 2015. I currently reside in Melrose with my fiance, Larry, and our lovable curmudgeon of a cat, Massimo.

I recently embarked on a new career in software engineering after more than 10 years as a corporate tax accountant. It was during my last few jobs in the tech industry that I noticed the engineers creating products designed to improve everyday life, which was for more impactful than the tax returns and financials I was preparing. I reached out to some of my developer friends for mentoring, and have since taken an Intro to CS Using Java I class at Harvard Extension and completed a full stack software development bootcamp at Launch Academy in Boston, where I learned to build web applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Express, NodeJS and various JavaScript frameworks and libraries, among other technologies.

I am currently riding the momentum I built up during my bootcamp and building on my technical skills. In particular, I am fine-tuning and adding features to Whatsupp, my final project at Launch Academy.

Non-techie activities I love include spending time with my family and friends, roller skating (I rediscovered my childhood passion during the pandemic), reading, knitting, cooking interesting recipes, and beautifying the home I share with Larry and Massimo. I also love taking advantage of all that Mother Nature has to offer in New England: hiking, going to the beach, camping, clamming and digging for oysters, and taking day trips to seaside towns. In the winter time, you're likely to find me hunkering down at home and getting cozy with a warm blanket and a good book.

As I continue to develop in my new profession, I'd love to put my technical knowledge to practice, so please email me if you'd like to collaborate!
