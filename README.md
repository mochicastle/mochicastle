My name is Michelle Wahng. I'm a native Californian, but have been a resident of Massachusetts since January 2015. I currently reside in Melrose with my fiance, Larry, and our lovable curmudgeon of a cat, Massimo.

I recently took a break from my career as a corporate tax professional to explore my interest in software development. I took an Intro to CS Using Java I class at Harvard Extension in Fall 2022 and completed a full stack software development bootcamp at Launch Academy in Boston, where I learned to build web applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Express, NodeJS and various JavaScript frameworks and libraries, among other technologies.

I am currently working on my portfolio website at www.mochicastle.com and thinking about adding additional functionalities to my web app, Whatsupp, and exploring ideas for new apps to build.

Non-techie activities I love include spending time with my family and friends, roller skating (I rediscovered my childhood passion during the pandemic), reading, knitting, cooking interesting recipes, and beautifying the home I share with Larry and Massimo. I also love taking advantage of all that Mother Nature has to offer in New England: hiking, going to the beach, camping, clamming and digging for oysters, and taking day trips to seaside towns. In the winter time, you're likely to find me hunkering down at home and getting cozy with a warm blanket and a good book.

As I continue to develop in my new profession, I'd love to put my technical knowledge to practice, so please email me if you'd like to collaborate!
